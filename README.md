# Math Stars

* This program is designed to keep track of students and their number of stars.
* It will be able to perform CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete students from the database.
* The goal of this program will be to minimize time spent managing student stars by hand and digitalize the reward system.
* Developed and testing utilizing XAMPP.

## To do list:

* Add a new table for student roster to keep track of index and active/inactive students
* Set that table relation to student table according to index
* Remove display table function/routine and have the display table button query the database itself
* Finish implementing register.php
    * Add a button to redirect back to login.php
* Implement password hashing to database instead of being stored in plain text


## Bugs:

* Nothing to note at the moment
